        <br>
    
            <h5>OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is a reference model that describes how information from a software
                application in one computer
                moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.
                OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function.
                OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, and it is now considered as an architectural model for the inter-computer communications.
                OSI model divides the whole task into seven smaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a particular task.
                Each layer is self-contained, so that task assigned to each layer can be performed independently.<br><br>
